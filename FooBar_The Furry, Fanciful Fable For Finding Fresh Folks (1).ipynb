Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...*\n",

The text went on to obsessively emphasize the importance of \"efficency,\" so I ran multiple versions through with the time module since I had never done efficiency testing before. The winning iteration is below. As a list comprehension, it was basically unreadable, and this exploited the fact that the integer values were singular, constant and requested.  "
